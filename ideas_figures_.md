## Molecules
- Iopamidol
- Polymer
- Monomer

## Main Points
- This approach could be applied to molecules with a single peak, for example: Ioxilan (Joey did it) but we don't do it here.
- The current approach does not necessarily apply to experimental conditions beyond those used durign the calibration
- The ML approach is more robust to varibel experimental conditions.
- Classification could be enough for many clinical applications.
- The image processing time is much faster because it does not require complicated Bloch fitting.
