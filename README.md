## Prediction of pH using acidoCEST MRI and machine learning

### Introduction
- Brief description of current acidoCEST method and its limitations
- Previous work in ML and why it could solve some of these issues. Previous work
by our lab
- Objective of this paper.

### Theory
- Short description of ML approach (learning and testing)
- Describe that our current methodology does not account for variable
experimental conditions, but it could do if we use an ML approach.
- Description of using the entire Z spectra.

### Methods
-ML and analysis
- Short description of ML approach (learning and testing)
- Lorentzian fitting
- Describe that our current methodology does not account for variable
experimental conditions, but it could do if we use an ML approach.
- Description of using the entire Z spectra.

-Experimental
- Samples
- MRI methods

### Results
- Regression
- standard method when applied to out-of-training data
- standard method when built using a ML approach
- Linear regression using entire spectra
- Classification
- standard method when applied to out-of-training data
- standard method when built using a ML approach
- Linear regression using entire spectra

### Discussion

- how does the method building method affect the accessible pH range
- limitation of current study
- conclusions
